<!--      General Terms-->
<!--    </h3>-->
<!--    <ol>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        First Deposit/Welcome Bonus can only be claimed once every 72 hours across all Casinos operating under the same license. Failure to comply may result in any winnings to be removed. To find out for which casinos this applies please contact support.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        If, at any point in time, after reading this policy something is not clear, or you would like to be blocked from receiving our bonuses and/or to have any bonuses removed from your account, please contact our Customer Support Department team before you commence play.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        If the bonus you were trying to claim does not appear automatically in your player’s account, please contact our Customer Support team, prior to placing any bets, and the bonus shall be credited for you.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        We reserve the right to cancel any amount in excess of the player's original deposit from a player's withdrawal if the wagering requirement has not been fulfilled or if the player requested to remove the bonus before the wagering requirements were fulfilled.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        Unless stated otherwise in the promotion offer bonuses are only available to players who made at least one successful deposit in their accounts.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        In the event that a technical misconfiguration or failure of any kind results in the incorrect number of free spins or an incorrectly added Bonus being placed on your account, we reserve the right to correct this by removing any winnings received and re-adding the reward with the correct configuration.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        A user is not allowed to register more than one account in the system. This means only one account is allowed to be registered per person, household, family, household address, email address, credit card number, e-wallet account or shared computer environment (example: a library, workplace, fraternity, university or school). Any attempt to try to deceive management by registering multiple accounts to gain bonus money will be deemed as bonus abuse and will result in the account(s) being suspended and the removal of your funds.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        While making bets to wager any deposit bonus/offer (free or deposit) or bonus credited for free spin winnings, the maximum bet permitted is 10% (min 0.10) of the bonus amount or 5 (eg, 5 EUR, 5 GBP, 500 INR) (the lower amount applies). Failure to comply with this rule means you are in breach of the deposit bonus/offer terms and We reserve the right to void and remove any winnings. A bet includes any special bet feature, any gamble function or any other type of wagering activity (regardless of its name).-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        Individual promotions may have additional terms and conditions which will override or contribute to the terms and conditions here stated. Please check carefully all terms and conditions associated with a bonus before taking part. Should the terms and conditions of the individual promotions conflict with the Bonus Policy, the individual promotions terms shall apply.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        Regardless of the currency that we advertise or display bonus amounts, the bonus will always be credited according to the currency your account is configured to.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        In accordance with the privacy policy, we regularly send promotional emails with bonus offers. You are only eligible for the bonus if you received the email directly from us. You may unsubscribe from receiving promotions by contacting customer support. If We determine that a specific customer did not receive that particular promotion as an intended exclusive targeted recipient that this promotion was sent out to, we will not honour any payout requests from the customer, even if they have met the wagering criteria.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        We reserve the right to cancel promotions or bonus offers, of any kind at any time, without prior notice. Any such cancellation will not affect an award already redeemed.-->
<!--      </li>-->

<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        Unless stated otherwise if the last bonus received by a player was a free bonus, a deposit needs to be made first before the player is eligible to use any further free bonuses, even if it was marketed to the player. Any breach of this term can result in blocking from future bonuses and/or removing any winnings that might have been the result of the use of any free bonus.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        If you receive free money (no deposit bonus/refer a friend bonus/registration bonus etc’) or free spins winnings, unless stated otherwise the maximum amount that you can win or withdraw from it is €100 or two times the bonus amount. The larger amount of the two will be applied. Any winnings greater than the applied amount, including winnings subsequently won from with that money even after any deposit, will be removed from your account. In addition, no winnings accrued in connection with any Free Bonus may be withdrawn until the wagering requirements have been met.-->

<!--        Wagering only counts for one bonus at a time according to the following rules:-->
<!--        <ol>-->
<!--          <li>-->
<!--            If there are bonuses restricted to a specific game or games, wagering will contribute to these bonuses first if that specific game is played.-->
<!--          </li>-->
<!--          <li>-->
<!--            If multiple bonuses are active with different wagering conditions, the wagering will be applied to the relevant bonus first in date order.-->
<!--          </li>-->
<!--          <li>-->
<!--            If there are two active bonuses with identical conditions, wagering will contribute to the bonuses in date order.-->
<!--          </li>-->
<!--          <li>-->
<!--            Please note that you will always first wager your real money funds and only when they are fully wagered, you will then start wagering your Bonus Balance.-->

<!--        If a bonus has not been used (turnover requirement met or lost) within 30 days, the bonus amount will be cancelled and removed from your account unless you have a real money balance.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        Unless otherwise stated you have up to 24 hours to meet the wagering requirements for Free Bonuses (non-deposit bonus, refer a friend, free spins received for free) before the bonus and any winnings are removed.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        In the case that bonus money is wagered and lost, but not all wager requirements were met, the next deposit made to your account, providing you don't have any open games, will automatically reset the bonus as Consumed and it will not be necessary to complete the remaining wager requirements. If you want to continue your game session and make sure that your bonus gets Consumed, please contact support after your deposit. Any abuse of this in order to avoid completing bonus wagering will result in all winnings being removed, and your deposit potentially being confiscated.-->
<!--      </li>-->
<!--      <li>-->
<!--        If you have a bonus consumed/cancelled/expired, either by the system or due to your own request, and the wagering was not completed, all your winnings will be removed including any pending/unclaimed winnings from games/promotions you played whilst you had the bonus.-->
