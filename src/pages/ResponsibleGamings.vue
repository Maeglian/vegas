<!--        Gambling is a form of entertainment, but it should be enjoyed responsibly. It´s not a way to earn a quick buck. You should always avoid chasing losses, never play with money that you can’t afford to lose, and never gamble for money that should go towards rent, bills or other expenses. You should check your activity regularly in the Balance page to keep on top of your money spent.-->

<!--        If you start to feel uncomfortable in any way due to your gambling, you should take a break from playing or even consider self-exclusion.-->

<!--      </p>-->
<!--      <ul>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          Children should not be left unattended in front of a computer.-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          When they reach the correct age, your children should be educated as to what gambling is and how it can affect them if it is not controlled.-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          Due to the emotion that can be emitted whilst gambling, do not allow children to watch or hear you while you are playing any of our games.-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          If any children have access to your computer, we recommend you do not use the check-box for remembering your password.-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          Do not allow children to access your credit card or any other payment information.-->
<!--        </li>-->
<!--        <li>-->
<!--          A different profile that only contains appropriate software and website access can be created on your computer for children. Parents playing our games can then use a different profile.-->

<!--        <li>-->
<!--          Parents should educate themselves on the dangers of underage gambling and act accordingly.-->
